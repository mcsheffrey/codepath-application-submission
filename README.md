# Codepath iOS (Swift) for designers application submission

This is my version of the Tipster app for the iOS (Swift) for designers course.

Time spent: 2-3 hours

- User can calculate tip for themselves
- User can calculate total bill for themsleves
- User can change tip percentage
- User can split bill between up to 4 people

Played around with some animation stuff too.
